Description: An implementation of the QUEFTS (Quantitative Evaluation of the Native Fertility of Tropical Soils) model. The model estimates nutrient requirements for crops to achieve a target yield given native soil fertility, as estimated from a few soil chemical properties. See Janssen et al. (1990) <doi:10.1016/0016-7061(90)90021-Z> for the technical details and Sattari et al. (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.fcr.2013.12.005> for a recent evaluation and improvements.
